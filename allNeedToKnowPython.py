''' variables '''
''' In other programming languages like C, C++, and Java, you will need to declare the
 type of variables but in Python you donâ€™t need to do that. Just type in the variable
  and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the 
  value given would be an int, float, or char or even a String. '''
